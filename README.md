# docker_projects
A basic docker project, where we used Traefik to distribute incoming HTTP(S) and TCP requests as load balancer. 
Services used:
whoami, meme generator
Middlewares:
test-compress, basic-auth, rateLimit, buffer

After this, I set up a virtual private network and made the docker work here with Tailscale.
